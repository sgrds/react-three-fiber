## Objective

Choose a 3D model (preferably a house) and use Three.js to create a scene that renders the model with the camera positioned at the top left of the model, tilted 45 degrees. Ensure the model is interactive, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and pan the model as they wish.

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
